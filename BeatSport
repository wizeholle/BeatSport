Beat Sport

Running is defined as the use of foot movement by terrestrial animals. Its definition of movement is a step in which feet do not reach the ground at the same time. It can also be an aerobic exercise or an anaerobic exercise.
Fitness running is generally best scheduled in the morning, followed by around 9 am and around 5 pm. Middle-aged people are generally arranged to exercise in the morning due to work. First, they do not conflict with work. 
Second, the morning running air is fresh, and fresh air is good for the respiratory system. 
In addition, when a person goes through sleep, his physical strength is restored, but physiologically, there is still a certain state of inhibition. 
Morning exercise is good for nerve excitement, excitement, and promotion of metabolism. It is good for keeping a good spirit and physical strength into one day's work.

1. The motion function will use GPS positioning, and running the GPS function in the background may consume a lot of battery power.
